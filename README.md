# Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Dataset Analysis

## Pre-requisites
1. Anaconda (2.7 or 3.4)
2. scikit-learn

Note: Having a GPU takes less time during the training.

## Dataset
UCI Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset [Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)

## Goal
To classify the handwrittend digit that is given as an input.

## Algorithms Used
The following algorithms have been used and analyzed for this dataset:
1. Decision Tree
2. KNN
3. Artificial Neural Networks
4. Adaboosting.
5. SVM
6. Naive Bayes.

## Analysis
The analysis is present in [Analysis.pdf](Analysis.pdf) and this gives a differentiation of how well each of the machine learning algorithms perform over the other in this particular dataset.
